        "Ans 1. The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages is how the code is executed:\n",
        "Compiled languages\n",
        "The entire code is converted into machine language before execution. This results in more efficient code that can be executed multiple times.\n",
        "Interpreted languages\n",
        "The code is executed line by line, without a separate compilation step. This makes it easier and faster to develop and test code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 2. Exception handling in Python is a way to prepare for and deal with errors that can occur while a program is running. It's a crucial part of writing reliable code and improving the user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 3. The purpose of a finally block in exception handling is to ensure that important code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown. This is useful for performing cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 4. Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 5. The __del__() method in Python is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is a powerful tool that helps manage resource cleanup when objects are destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 6. The difference between import and from import in Python is: import imports an entire code library. from import imports a specific member or members of the library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 7- In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using try-except blocks. Here are some ways to handle multiple exceptions in Python:\n",
        "Use a single except clause\n",
        "Use multiple except blocks\n",
        "use an else cause\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 8- The with statement in Python is used to simplify the management of resources that need to be acquired and released in a specific order. It provides a way to wrap the execution of a block of code with methods defined by a context manager.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9- Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 10- advantages\n",
        "a. It helps debug errors easily.\n",
        "b. It's more perceptive than traceback methods.\n",
        "c. It can be used to save info on warnings, errors and other events.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 11- The memory manager is responsible for allocating memory to Python objects and tracking which objects are currently in use. Python has two types of memory that it uses: stack memory and heap memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 12- The basic steps for exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "Use the try() function: The try() function is used to catch and handle exceptions that may occur while a block of code is executing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the except block: The except block is used to execute code and handle exceptions that arise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the else block: The else block runs if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the try-except-finally block: The try-except-finally block is the primary mechanism for exception handling in Python. It allows you to catch exceptions, handle them gracefully, and execute cleanup code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 13- Memory management is important in Python because it helps write efficient code, reduce the risk of errors and crashes, and improve program performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "efficient code\n",

        "fewer errors and crashes\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans 19- Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 20. The `read()` method will read the entire content of the file or stream if no argument is provided, returning a string. On the other hand, the `readline()` method reads a single line up to the newline character (`\\n`) and returns it as a string.\n",
